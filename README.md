#Modulo

Modulo is an iPhone web app that addresses a major missing feature in the iPhone's built-in Calculator application -- the [modulo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) operation.

##To Do

- Make the information panel and make the i button toggle some information using jQuery.
- Make the app remember the last answer so that when the user quits the app and opens it up again, the same answer will be there.
- Check whether user agent is Safari on iPhone. If not, tell user to go to the page on their iPhone.
- Stop the page from rotating (if possible?)
