#Modulo

Modulo is an iPhone web app that addresses a major missing feature in the iPhone's built-in Calculator application -- the [modulo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) operation.

##Features

- Modulo is fully persistent -- if you do a calculation and quit the app, your values (the dividend, the divisor and the answer) will be there when you open it up again. This makes it really easy to switch between Modulo and the iPhone's Calculator app.

##To Do

- CSS transition for the information panel.
- Offline caching.
